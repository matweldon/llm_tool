I have a text file that looks like this:

%%Prompt%%
Hello assistant

%%Response%%
Hello there.

%%Prompt%%
What is the capital of France?

%%Response%%
... <file continues>

I have a python function that reads the file into memory as an object called `file_contents`. Now I'd like to parse the file
as a list of dictionaries like this:

`[
{"role": "prompt", "text": "Hello assistant"},
{"role": "response", "text": "Hello there"},
{"role": "prompt", "text": "What is the capital of France?"},
{"role": "response", "text": ... }
...]`

How do I do this? Give a python snippet that parses the file contents with no or minimal dependencies. Don't give any explanation
