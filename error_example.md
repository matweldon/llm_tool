This error message indicates that there's a problem with importing the Django framework in your Python project. Here's a breakdown of what's happening:

1. You're trying to run a Django management command using `python manage.py runserver`.

2. The script is failing because it can't find the Django module. The specific error is: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'django'`.

3. This leads to an `ImportError` with the message: "Couldn't import Django. Are you sure it's installed and available on your PYTHONPATH environment variable? Did you forget to activate a virtual environment?"

This error typically occurs when:

1. Django is not installed in your current Python environment.
2. You're not in the correct virtual environment where Django is installed.
3. There's an issue with your PYTHONPATH not including the directory where Django is installed.

To resolve this, you should:

1. Make sure Django is installed. You can do this by running `pip install django` in your terminal.
2. If you're using a virtual environment, ensure it's activated before running the command.
3. Verify that your PYTHONPATH includes the directory where Django is installed.

The error message itself is quite helpful, as it suggests checking if Django is installed and if you've activated the correct virtual environment. It appears you're in a virtual environment (as indicated by the (.venv) in your command prompt), but it might not be the one where Django is installed.
